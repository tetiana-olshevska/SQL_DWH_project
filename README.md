# SQL Data Warehouse Project
This project is aimed at building and designing Data Warehouse using SQL Server that follows a layered Medallion Architecture. It demonstrates the full ETL pipeline process, from ingesting raw ERP and CRM data to transforming it into a structured, analytical format (star schema) that supports reporting, business intelligence, and data-driven decision-making.

## üèóÔ∏è Data Architecture

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

## üîß Project Components

- ETL Pipelines: SQL scripts that extract, transform, and load data across the three layers.
- Data Modeling: Design of fact and dimension tables to support analytical queries.
- Analytics & Reporting: SQL-based reports providing insights into customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends.
